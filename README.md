# Quizzapp
"Who wants to be a millionare"-like quiz game.
It allows to create the questions for the game. 
Before trying to start playing, please be sure to add at least one question 
per level(level ranging from 1 to 5 where 5 is the highest difficulty level for the question)

The Toolbar on top has the menu options(Home, Question manager, History) to navigate thoughout the app.

You are meant to choose one out of the four possible answers for the questions in order to move forward to the
next game level question. It is worth it to know that the player has 15 seconds to submit answer or your game session will be discarded
with no points.
Each correctly answered question rewards certain amount of points depending on the level for a total cumulated reward of 200 points
when the five levels are fullfilled.

At the end the player is required to type'in its name/nickname to save the record.
